# Hyperfight Palette Editor
Source to the HYperfight Palette Editor project. This software allows users to more easily create/edit/delete paletes using a graphical editor or palette management system.

This project started approximately a year ago but was cut short and the source to the project is currently unavailable.
The current source code is an adapted model of the previous Hyperfight Palette Editor with many major updates being made to how the software works.
This version of the Hyperfight Palette Editor also includes many aditional features which where not present in the original.
Features such as the palette managedment system and the palette json configuration are completely new.
