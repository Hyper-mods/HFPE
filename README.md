# Project archived and no longer under development
HYPERFIGHT's popularity has dwindled and I have moved to other projects. Thank you to all of you who have supported the development of this project thus far. If HYPERFIGHT's popularity increases or a new version of HYPERFIGHT is released (e.g. HYPERFIGHT 2) I will consider restarting development of this tool. The project is open source and so if anyone would like to continue development please do!

Thank you, tokorv.
