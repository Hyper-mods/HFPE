# Hyperfight Palette Editor
Source code of the Hyperfight Palette Editor project. This software allows users to more easily create/edit/delete palettes from the gaame: Hyperfight. This software includes a graphical editor and a palette management system.
The Hyperfight Palette Editor is written in Python using PyQt5 for the Graphical User Interface.

This project started approximately a year ago but was cut short and the source to the original project is currently unavailable.
The current source code is an adapted model of the previous Hyperfight Palette Editor with many major updates being made to how the software works.
This version of the Hyperfight Palette Editor also includes many aditional features which where not present in the original.
Features such as the palette managment system and the palette json configuration are completely new.

Please enjoy the software as you like. You have my full permission to modify the source code directly using pull requests or creating your own remixed version of the editor ( as long as credit is given to the original developer, me).
